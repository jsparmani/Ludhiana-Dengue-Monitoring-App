    <h3>Weekly Dry Day</h3>
    <br>

    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">
            ●  The adult aedes mosquito develops in
                    one week (average 7-10 days) from egg <br>
            ● The eggs of aedes can stick to the walls
                    of the water container and survive for more
                    than one year<br>
            ● If the containers are dried once a week
                then the development of adult mosquito
                from the egg can be prevented <br>
            ● The Department of Health and Family
                Welfare has declared EVERY FRIDAY A DRY DAY
                Which means that each household and
                office should ensure that the cooler, water
                containers, flower vases, tyres, flower pots,
                water tanks and all those places where
                clean water is stored should be cleaned
                once a week. Thus breeding of aedes can
                be prevented.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style = "font-size: 18px; font-weight:900;">a.</strong> In the water containers, which can't
                be emptied, water can be sprayed with
                larvicides like Temephos or Bti or oil can be
                sprinkled on the water. <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style = "font-size: 18px; font-weight:900;">b.</strong> Oil when sprinkled on water forms a
                thin layer and cuts off oxygen supply to
                the larvae and pupae thus killing them and
                preventing the development of aedes.<br>
